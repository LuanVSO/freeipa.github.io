Visual:

#. Use word "Details" instead of "User Details" in "tab" navigation
#. Change buttons from "Reset" and "Update" to "Cancel" "Reset" and
   "Save Changes"
#. Question: do we allow multiple email addresses
#. Consider: making tabs out of "Details" Groups, "Netgvroups" etc.

Code:

#. "Save Changes", "Cancel" and "Reset" buttons are grayed out until the
   data on page have been changed

Mock-up:
