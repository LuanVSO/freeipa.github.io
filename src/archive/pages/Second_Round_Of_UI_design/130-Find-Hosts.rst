Visual:

#. Use word "Details" instead of "Properties" in help text and icon name
#. Change icon help from "Edit Properties" to "Details"
#. Remove icon currently labeled "Host Details"
#. Question: Do we allow "Cloning" a host?
#. Question: Should we group actions differently? Move "Delete" and
   "Clone" to end, after a space
#. Add screen title: "Find Hosts"
#. Column Headings

-  

   -  Change "Enrolled" to "Enrolled (Y/N)"

Code:

#. In help area, make sure to dynamically finish the sentence, "Matches
   are made in the following fields:
#. Tool Tip: ensure that a hover over the "Actions" icons show the
   proper name of the button
#. Expand the list region to match the number of entries -- allow the
   entire page to scroll

Mock-up:

#. Link Host Name to "Details" page
#. Enrolled is either "Y" or "N"
