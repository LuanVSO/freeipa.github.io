Visual:

#. Use word "Details" instead of "Properties" in help text and icon name
#. Change icon help from "Edit Properties" to "Details"
#. Change icon help from "Clone a user" to "Clone"
#. Question: Should we group actions differently? Move "Delete" and
   "Clone" to end, after a space
#. Add screen title: "Find Groups"
#. Column Headers:

-  

   -  "#Direct Members" becomes "# Direct Members"
   -  "Direct Subgroups" becomes "# Direct Subgroups"

#. Action Icons in help area: stack 2 in a column

Code:

#. In help area, make sure to dynamically finish the sentence, "Matches
   are made in the following fields:
#. Tool Tip: ensure that a hover over the "Actions" icons show the
   proper name of the button
#. Expand the list region to match the number of entries -- allow the
   entire page to scroll

Mock-up:

#. Link Group Name to "Details" page
#. "Direct Subgroups is a number
